1. Create empty database (e.g. with command line)
    `create database ee_logging`

2. Create the three empty tables needed by logback (logging_event, logging_event_exception,
logging_event_property). This may be done with the ddl script provided in this folder
(logback_db_definition.ddl).

3. Configure database url, database name, user and password which are accessed in the `logback.xml`
config file.
I wrote these values into the `mysql.properties` file located in this folder to avoid uploading
credentials to git repositories.
