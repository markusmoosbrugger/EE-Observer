1. Create a MySQL database instance (e.g. on localhost, Google or AWS) --> see instructions in mysql
 folder

2. Connect to the database server and execute the script "sql_db_definition.ddl" --> The database
should be created now and an example entry is inserted. By default, a database with the name
"ee_observer" is created. If you like to create another database or use an already existing
 one, please update the name in the .ddl script.

3. Create and configure `jdbc.properties` file located in this directory with the required
properties. Please make sure that the database name in the .ddl script matches the property db_name
in the .properties file.
