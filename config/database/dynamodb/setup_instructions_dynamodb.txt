1. Go to the AWS developer console and search for DynamoDB

2. Create Table
    - Table name: FunctionInvocations
    - Partition key: typeId (String)
    - Add sort key: timestamp (Number)
    - Table settings: Disable default settings
    - Secondary indexes: Add index
        - Partition key: implementationId (String)
        - Sort key: timestamp (Number)
    - Click on Create

3. It takes a few minutes and afterwards the database instance is ready

4. You can have a look at your table by going to Menu --> Tables --> Items

5. To access the database from the project you need AWS access keys which can be
created in AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
    - Permissions policies: e.g. AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess
    - Create access key and store values in `dynamodb.properties`

6. Now you should be able to execute `DynamoRunner` and then you can have a look at the entries in
your DynamoDB table
