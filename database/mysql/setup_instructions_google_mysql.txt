1. Select or create a google cloud project

2. Go to the cloud SQL instances page in the google cloud console

3. Create database instance
    - Database engine: MySQL (also other DB engines supported by logback)
    - Enable Compute Engine API
    - Instance info:
        - Instance id: ee-logging
        - Password
        - Database version: MySQL 8.0
    - Region and zonal availability
        - Region: europe-west3 (Frankfurt)
        - Single zone
    - Machine type
        - Shared core 1 vCPU
        - Storage: SSD
        - Storage capacity: 10 GB
        - Enable automatic storage increases: not enabled
    - Connections
        - Public IP
        - Add Network
            - name: any
            - network: 0.0.0.0/0    --> this allows to access the database from any client
    - Backups
        - default settings
    - Maintenance
        - default settings


3. Connect to the database using the command line or any other tool capable of connecting to mysql
databases
    - Endpoint: [IP Address] (can be seen in the google cloud console --> Public IP address)
    - Port: 3306

4. Create database ee_logging. This can be done either via the google cloud console (Databases -->
Create database) or by connecting to the database instance by using any MySQL client.

5. Create the three empty tables needed by logback (logging_event, logging_event_exception,
logging_event_property). This may be done with the ddl script provided in this folder
(logback_db_definition.ddl).

6. Configure database url, database name, user and password which are accessed in the `logback.xml`
config file.
I wrote these values into the `mysql.properties` file located in this folder to avoid uploading
credentials to git repositories.
