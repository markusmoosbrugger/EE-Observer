1. Select your region in AWS developer console and search Amazon RDS page

2. Create database
    - Engine options: MySQL (also other DB engines supported by logback)
    - Edition: MySQL Community
    - Version: MySQL 8.0.21
    - Templates: Free Tier
    - Settings:
        - DB instance identifier: ee-logging
        - Master username (--> store in credentials.env)
        - Master password (--> store in credentials.env)
    - DB instance class: db.t2.micro (included in AWS free tier)
    - Storage:
        - Storage type: General Purpose (SSD)
        - Allocated storage: 20 GB
        - Enable storage autoscaling: not enabled
    - Connectivity:
        - Virtual private cloud and subnet group: default
        - Public access: Yes
        - VPC security group: default
        - Database port: 3306
    - Additional configuration:
        - Initial database name: ee_logging
        - Backup: default settings
        - Monitoring: enable logs

3. Connect to the database using the command line or any other tool capable of connecting to mysql
databases
    - I had the issue that connections outside the VPC were still not allowed even if I had set
    public access to Yes in the setup. I added another inbound rule for the selected security
    group in the AWS developer console which resolved the issue.
    - Endpoint (shown in AWS developer console): ee-logging.XXXXXXXXXXXX.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws
    .com
    - Port: 3306

4. Create the three empty tables needed by logback (logging_event, logging_event_exception,
logging_event_property). This may be done with the ddl script provided in this folder
(logback_db_definition.ddl).

5. Configure database url, user and password in the `logback.xml` config file. I wrote these values
into the `credentials.env` file located in this folder to avoid uploading credentials to
git repositories.
