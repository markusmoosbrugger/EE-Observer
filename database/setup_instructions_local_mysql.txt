1. Create empty database (e.g. with command line)
    `create database ee_logging`

2. Create the three empty tables needed by logback (logging_event, logging_event_exception,
logging_event_property). This may be done with the ddl script provided in this folder
(logback_db_definition.ddl).

3. Configure database url, user and password in the `logback.xml` config file. For the username and
password I used the `credentials.env` file located in this folder to avoid uploading credentials to
git repositories.
